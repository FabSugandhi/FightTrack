                complete and accurate information when you register for an account and keep the
                information current. This is important because sometimes we may need to send you
                notable updates (for example, about changes to our Terms of Service or Privacy
                Policy), or we may want to let you know about and make informed choices in
                response to legal inquiries or complaints.

                activities that occur under your account and any other actions taken in connection
                with our Services. You shall not share or misuse your access credentials. You must
                immediately notify us of any unauthorized uses of your account, store, or website,
                or of any other breach of security. We will not be liable for any acts or omissions by
                you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or
                omissions.

                    <p>	
                      Some of our Services are offered for a fee. By using a Paid Service, you agree to
                      pay any specified fees associated with specific features. Depending on the Paid Service,
                      there may be one-time fees, recurring fees, or revenue-based fees. For recurring
                      fees, we’ll bill or charge you for in regular automatically-renewing intervals (such as
                      monthly, annually, or biennially), on a pre-pay basis until you cancel, which you can
                      do at any time by contacting the relevant support team.

                  <li>Payment</li>		
                    <p>
                      If your payment fails or if Paid Services are otherwise not paid for or paid for on
                      time, we may immediately cancel or revoke your access to the Paid Services. If you
                      contact your bank or credit card company to decline or reverse the charge of fees
                      for Paid Services, we may revoke your access to our Services in general.

                  <li>Fee Changes</li>

                      We may change our fees at any time, or start charging fees for Services that were
                      previously free. When applicable, we may give you advance notice of the fee
                      changes. If you don’t agree with the fee changes, you must cancel your Paid
                      Service.

                intellectual property rights of others. If you believe that material located on or
                associated with one of our products or services violates your copyright, please

              <p>
                The Agreement does not transfer from FightTrack to you any intellectual
                property, and all right, title, and interest in and to such property will remain (as

            <li className="mt-4">Changes</li>
              <p>
                We are constantly updating our Services and that means sometimes we have to
                change the legal terms under which our Services are offered. If we make changes
                that are material, we will let you know by posting on one of our blogs, or by sending
                you an email or other communication before the changes take effect. The notice will
                designate a reasonable period of time after which the new terms will take effect. If
                you disagree with our changes, then you should stop using our Services within the
                designated notice period, or once the changes become effective. Your continued
                use of our Services will be subject to the new terms. However, any dispute that
                arose before the changes shall be governed by the Terms (including the binding
                individual arbitration clause) that were in place when the dispute arose.
              </p>
          <li className="mt-4">Jurisdiction and Applicable Law</li>
              <p>
                Except to the extent any applicable law provides otherwise, the Agreement and any
                access to or use of our Services will be governed by the laws of
                FightTrack excluding its conflict of law provisions. The proper venue for
                any disputes arising out of or relating to the Agreement and any access to or use of
                our Services will be the state and federal courts.
              </p>
          <li className="mt-4">Miscellaneous</li>
              <p>
                The Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between  FightTrack and
                you concerning the subject matter hereof. If any part of the Agreement is held
                invalid or unenforceable, that part will be construed to reflect the parties’ original
                intent, and the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. A waiver by
                either party of any term or condition of the Agreement or any breach thereof, in any
                one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach
                thereof. You may assign your rights under the Agreement to any party that consents
                to, and agrees to be bound by, its terms and conditions;  FightTrack may
                assign its rights under the Agreement without condition. The Agreement will be
                binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and
                permitted assigns.
